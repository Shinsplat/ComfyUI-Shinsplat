# :wrench: ComfyUI Convenience Nodes

## Nodes

- These modified (Clip Text Encode) and (Clip Text Encode SDXL) nodes allows the use of BREAK so you can split up your context, the END directive that allows you to skip all text after, pony features and a prompt counter with token display.
- This modified (LoRA Loader) will automatically extract metadata and potentially read trigger phrases/words.

##	BREAK

	These two nodes allow the use of the "BREAK" directive.

	During my search for nodes that break up context in a prompt I discovered
	a handful that purported to perform this task.  After utilizing all of them
	I did not get any consistent described results, from any of them.

	After creating my BREAK alternative I found that "Conditioning (Concat)"
	performs similarly but I like having the convenience of being able to put
	BREAK in my prompt wherever I want.

	While I have never experienced BREAK in my travels with Automatic1111,
	which was brief, I've read that this special term is used in their prompt
	evaluator in order to generate separate blocks, possibly in an attempt to
	control context.  While the implementation intent does not appear to control
	context, in any significant way, my altered node does allow this directive
	to designate where a block starts, by ending a previous block.

## PROMPTS

	I wanted, for quite awhile, to have a prompt evaluation tool so I wrote it.
	Along with the block and token data, that is presented as a result of my
	attempt at the BREAK directive, I also implemented a prompt expander, which
	is a second text output from these two nodes, showing you exactly what the
	interpreter sees as prompts.

	I also added a "prompt" output, since I was uncertain where to find one
	that just piped the text out in order to share with other nodes.  The
	encoder doesn't receive the commented out bits since it is intercepted
	before it even gets to the node so you won't get a prompt text output
	that contains //this here .. or .. /* that there */ .  The node does not
	have access to this.  One might wonder why I didn't just use a text node
	to begin with and I would nod but also know that the ones I've used do
	not support filtering comments.

	These last are for the regular encoder, not the advanced one for SDXL, though
	the regular encoder works for SDXL models as well of course.  I added this
	for my convenience so that I could more easily pull in my LoRA prompt
	outputs from my custom LoRA loader, after merging them in some fashion.

    "prompt_before" - input
    A text input prepended to the existing prompt, but after any pony tags if applicable.

    "prompt_after" - input
    A text input appended to the existing prompt.

    Pony tags will not be included in the output text, prompt.  However, the input
    text "prompt_before" and "prompt_after" will be added to the "prompt".

## END

	I also added an "END" directive.  So often I've just wanted to alter the
	prompt at the top and skip everything else, as a quick test, but I've
	had to resort to using the 'C' style block comment /*...*/, which is fine
	but inconvenient, so I can now just put my short prompt, finish it with END,
	and the remaining text won't be evaluated.

## PONY

	For those who use the PonyXL models there is a "pony" switch to add the
	score data to the beginning of your prompt automatically, without having
	to type it, and it will also add the expected "BREAK" command, so the
	prepended line to your prompt will be ...

	score_9, score_8_up, score_7_up, score_6_up, score_5_up, score_4_up, BREAK

	What I have learned, at least I think I have, is that it's best to have
	all scores included, though it can still pose a mystery and sometimes I
	find that removing lower scores can fix a broken prompt but I know that
	the issue is elsewhere.

	The SDXL version of the Clip Text Encode have _g and _l input strings
	and the reason for the separation doesn't appear to be documented.

	I'm uncertain if it's valuable or not but I added the pony switch to both
	the _g and _l terms separately.  With respect to the SDXL and Simple
	encoder, what I have noticed is if you use the same prompt criteria in
	both _g and _l text areas you get the same result as if you had used the
	simple Clip Text Encoder, if using the default resolutions, which
	duplicates the _l into _g on the back-end.

	Note that, before these nodes, your BREAK command did absolutely nothing
	to condition your prompt in ComfyUI and is, instead, lowercased to a term,
	whatever "break" does.  In my implementation the uppercase word, BREAK,
	never gets past to a token block and is removed by my code.  If you
	actually want to say "break" just do so, the lower case version is passed
	to the evaluator.  As a matter of fact you'll notice that, at least in
	ComfyUI, everything is reduced to lowercase anyway and this is why I can
	implement a directive structure using upper case terms, which I may add
	to later.

	Also note that it doesn't matter where you place directive code, it will
	be removed and your prompt will be restructured without it.

## CLIP_INVERT / POOL_INVERT / CLIP_SHIFT / POOL_SHIFT

    I'm having some fun goofing with the data, these just do a bit of fiddling with
    the return values of tensors.  How I manipulate them probably isn't important
    and certainly doesn't seem to produce any practical results so this is just for
    entertainment.

    There are two blocks returned, cond seems to be the clip side and pool is something
    else, each with different lengths of tensors it seams.  The clip and pool weights will be
    shifted by half of their length, which is the only value that seems to provide
    a visual that isn't garbage, and the invert method will just flip the array's of each.

	Check the "prompt" output to see if these key phrases are present and, if any of
	them are, then they were type in wrong unless there's a bug.

LoRA Loader

    When I first started making pictures with SD I didn't realize how important the
    keywords, or "trigger words", would be and neglected to copy them for later use.
    Since then I've amassed quite a few models and was unable to figure out how to
    use them without going back to the source, if I was able to even find it, and
    get the information from there.  So I copied the LoRA loader node and added
    some code to it that will examine the header of the safetensor file and
    spit out the key words, or phrases, that were used during training.  There's,
    often times, more key-words/phrases in the header than what was exposed to the
    general public, which may not be useful at all but I find it interesting to
    tinker with.

	For now it can only read Kohya headers for specific data, as far as I know,
	but there are two outputs, one for cherry picked data for convenience, and the
	other is the entirety of the meta-data, which could be huge or almost nothing
	at all.

	I see a growing trend, or maybe it's a default feature, of meta-data being
	stripped, or simply not included, in these files and I hope that will change
	in the future so that we always have a way to identify trigger phrases.

## pass_through

	You can use this to pass the text path from one LoRA to another.  I use this
	in order to test different checkpoint models with the same set of LoRAs.

	This probably loads the LoRA each time it's addressed.  Use the path_out
	to the path_in of the target LoRAs, then enable pass_through on the target.

## weight_clip / weight_model

	These inputs are for strings, even though they will be turned into floats.
	I used strings because it's easier to manage, and type, and I'm not sure
	there's a node that's as convenient as text.  You just type your floats in
	there and the node will convert it, iterate through your floats and stop
	iterating when the largest set has run out.

	Both model and clip strength are supported.  If one set is smaller than the
	the other then the smallest will be padded with what is present in the LoRA
	strength counterpart.  If any input should change the iterator starts over
	from a clean slate.

	It may be important to understand that the associated LoRA is not loaded
	multiple times, but must be paired with the associated model in order to
	tailor the weights for each iteration.  As far as I can tell this is
	unavoidable because of the way LoRAs work with a model but the short pause
	isn't as long as loading an initial model and you may just want to set it
	to run and leave it while you go do other things.
	
## prompt_in /  prompt_out

	These, in order, pull in a prompt from a string primitive, saves it to a file
	located in the LoRA folder where the LoRA is, and can be reused as prompt
	output to be combined with your other prompt conditioning pipeline.  The
	data is saved in a plain text file with a new extension (.prompt.txt) .

	If "prompt_in" is hooked up, and there is content, it will overwrite the
	existing prompt associated with this LoRA, writing it to the text file.
	Note that this is not trigger data associated with the meta-data, your LoRA
	is not altered in any way.  This is just a way to automatically load
	additional prompt words and is convenient if you use the same set of prompt
	words for some LoRAs.

Sum Wrap

	An incrementor with a target (ceiling), steps to that target and what to
	revert to after reaching the target (wrap).  Negative and positive values
	can be used.  If you do your math wrong it will overshoot, that's up to you.
	
    start - where to start
    step - what to add
    ceiling - the ceiling where we return to "start"
    wrap - where to return to after hitting the ceiling
    clear - reset the stored data

    t_out - where we are now (string for convenience)
    i_out - integer output

Green Box

	A node that iterates through a list of prompts.

	These can be chained together, connecting their "chain" in/out and on the
	very last one you connect your "prompt" to your other inputs/encoder.

	I previously hoped that comments could be added to the boxes so I tried
	to evaluate the lines to that end, but ran into a bug.  So, now we just do
	1 line per prompt, like in wild-cards, and later this will also be able to
	read those files and other text files.

	The chain output is to link up multiple Green Box nodes.  The final output
	is contained within the "prompt" output port.

	The loop option will start that node from the top after it runs out of prompts,
	the "enabled" can be disabled so that this prompt doesn't function but it will
	still pass the "chain" and "start_over", when True, will set the start bit to
	True so that the node can start from the beginning of the prompt list.

	The "start_over" option will read the text again and place the pointer at the
	top of the list.

	Just add one prompter per line, ending that particular prompt is done using
	<enter>, which is equal to the "new line" character.

	"_int/_flt" - output

	Converts lines into these types on the respective outputs.

## END

	Everything after this uppercase term is ignored.

Python / Python More

	A very simple node that I was unable to find from day one, so I made it.  It's
	just a way to manipulate data incoming and outgoing.  Just type in your python
	in the text box, manipulating any of the inputs and send the result to the
	outputs or not even that, you can perform any local task even file manipulation,
	loading, saving, etc.  The so called-built in variables are the input and output
	names, this is how you access those ports...

	if "dog" in str_in.lower():
		str_out = str_in + " " + "in a park"
	if "man" in str_in.lower():
		str_out = str_in + " " + "making sandwiches"
	if "woman" in str_in.lower():
		str_out = str_in + " " + "operating a jackhammer"

	The "More" alternative has 2 each of the types, so you can use this as a gate
	as well as combine inputs to outputs.


Hex to Other

	Convert a string representation of a hex value to an integer/float outpuot.


Text To Tokens

	before_ / after_

	Provides two inputs for standard text prompting.  Provides a standard text output
	that will contain the sandwiched text area between before_ and after_.

	tokens_

	This outputs a text representation of tokenized values that the CLIP Tokens Encode
	node can utilize.  These tokens are split words, understood by the evaluator.  The
	utilization of this is to be able to weight the resulting tokens separately, instead
	of each split word being its full defined weight.  For instance, the word unrelenting
	will be broken up into 3 tokens, (un, rel, enting), and the Text To Tokens promcess,
	along with the Tokens Encode, will allow for weighting each of these encoded values
	separately.

	Example output:

		{"word": "un", "token": 569, "weight": 1.0, "clip": "g", "index": 0},
		{"word": "rel", "token": 1825, "weight": 1.0, "clip": "g", "index": 1},
		{"word": "enting</w>", "token": 20526, "weight": 1.0, "clip": "g", "index": 2},
		{"word": "un", "token": 569, "weight": 1.0, "clip": "l", "index": 0},
		{"word": "rel", "token": 1825, "weight": 1.0, "clip": "l", "index": 1},
		{"word": "enting</w>", "token": 20526, "weight": 1.0, "clip": "l", "index": 2},

	The output will be different depending on the clip in use.  I should have this working
	with t5xxl, SD 1.5, SD3 and Cascade.  If it doesn't work then I goofed up somewhere,
	I'd appreciate if someone lets me know.

CLIP Tokens Encode *more below

Tensor Toys / Text To Tokens / Clip Tokens Encode

	These work together though you don't actually need Tensor Toys to use the TT pair.
	See the file Tensor_Toys.txt for more information or look at the header of
	shinsplat_tensor_toys.py.

	Basically Tensor Toys gives you control over how the weights are prepared, or offered
	at all, to the rest of your work-flow.  Using a zero weight feature, without a prompt,
	will give you "themed" material based on the images that were used to train the model.

	There are other parameters that will dig deeper into the model, the results are not
	guaranteed to be SFW, what you find is your own fault.
