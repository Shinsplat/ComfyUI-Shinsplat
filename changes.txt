		I added a couple of switches to improve my entertainment value,
		they shift the tensor weights and reverse them.  The results
		are not unpleasnt.

		And on this same day I turned these switches into directives
		because I didn't like the clutter.

		CLIP_INVERT
		POOL_INVERT
		CLIP_SHIFT
		POOL_SHIFT
