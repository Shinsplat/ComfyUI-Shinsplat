		I expected to utillize comments in the prompts so people could
		make notes.  After testing multi-line elements, again, I ran
		into an issue, so instead of the more complex quoted prompts
		I've decided to just read lines, and ignore redundant line breaks.
		So your prompt iterations will be separated by the line ending \n
		so hitting the <enter> after a prompt, like you'll find in
		wildcard files, is the way to go.

		The prompt_before wasn't working properly, should be fixed now.

		I added a couple of switches to improve my entertainment value,
		they shift the tensor weights and reverse them.  The results
		are not unpleasnt.

		And on this same day I turned these switches into directives
		because I didn't like the clutter.

		CLIP_INVERT
		POOL_INVERT
		CLIP_SHIFT
		POOL_SHIFT
